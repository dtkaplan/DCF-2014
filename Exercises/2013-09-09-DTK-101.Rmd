## Data Entry Problem

Give out the course reviews from 155.  Split people into groups of 4.  Ask them to figure out a plan for organizing the data, describe it in an Rmd document, and enter the data into a Google spreadsheet.  Their purpose: be able to see if 

* individuals differ in their typical response and what the spread is between individuals.
* answers to individual questions differ?
* answers are systematically different for people who felt they liked the course or will use the material.

We'll plan how to answer these questions this week, then revise and implement the plan in future weeks.
