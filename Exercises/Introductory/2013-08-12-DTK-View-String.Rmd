Newcomers often get confused about the difference between a quoted character string and an object name.  You're going to explore the difference using the `View()` function.  `View()` lets you see the contents of objects.

1. Look briefly at the documentation, via the `help()` function, for the data table `msleep` (in the `ggplot2` package).
#. Look at the data table itself: `View( msleep )`
#. Now do the same thing, but using the quoted character string `"msleep"` rather than the name of the object.  That is, `View( "msleep" ).

In your own words, briefly explain the difference between `msleep` and `"msleep"`.

`r I(textItem(name="viewString",rows=4,totalPts=10))`
