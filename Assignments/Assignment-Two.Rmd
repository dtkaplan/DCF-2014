### Simple Plotting

Use the `mScatter()` function to generate a graphic, as follows:
```{r}
data( NHANES )
Small <- sample_n( NHANES, size=1000 ) # for faster plotting
```{r eval=FALSE}
DCF::mScatter( Small )
```


Set up the mapping from variables to graphical attributes like this:

![Attributes set using `DCF::mScatter()`](Images/mScatter-1.png)

Once you have made the plot, describe briefly the meaning, in everyday human terms, of the pattern displayed in the scatterplot. (You can find the definitions of the variables using `help( NHANES )`.)

```{r eval=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
# The resulting plot
ggplot(data=Small,aes(x=age,y=height))+
  geom_point()+aes(colour=sex)+aes(size=diabetic)
```

Include an R chunk in your write-up that generates the graph.

### Make this Plot

Using the data in `Small`, make this plot with `DCF::mScatter()`:

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=Small,aes(x=bmi,y=weight))+
  geom_point()+aes(colour=smoker)
```

Write down the mapping between variables and graphical attributes.

### Counting Votes

Using the `Minneapolis2013` data table, answer these questions:

1. How many cases are there?
#. Who were the top 5 candidates in the `Second` vote selections.
#. How many ballots are marked "undervote" in 
    * `First` choice selections?
    * `Second` choice selections?
    * `Third` choice selections?
#. What are the top 3 combinations of `First` and `Second` vote selections?  (That is, of all the possible ways a voter might have marked his or her first and second choices, which received the highest number of votes?)
#. Which `Precinct` had the highest number of ballots cast?

### Zip Codes

Using the `ZipGeography` data

Find the total land area and population in each state.

* Make a scatter plot showing the relationship between land area and population for each state. 
* Make a [choropleth map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) showing the population of each state.
* Make a choropleth map showing the population per unit area of each state.  

Using the `ZipDemography` data
 
* Make a scatter plot showing the relationship, if any, between the number of `Foreignborn` people in a zip code and the number who `SpeakalanguageotherthanEnglishathome5yearsandover`.  (Such long variable names are to be avoided.)


Explain what would keep you, at this point, from calculating the fraction of people in each state who have a `Bachelorsdegreeorhigher`.  Say how you would go about constructing such a plot --- but don't actually do it!  Too much work.
