1. Using the RStudio editor, create an R/Markdown document.  The Rmd document should be named `AssignmentOne.Rmd`. The document you **hand-in** should be named `AssignmentOne.html`.
    a. Find two **data-oriented** graphics.  Give a URL link to them, or include them in the Rmd document.  Describe briefly the topic the graphics apply to and what is the form of the data underlying the graphics. Taking a picture of a graph in a textbook is perfectly acceptable.  Here are some examples drawn from Wikipedia.

    b. Find a **schematic** graphic oriented toward science. Include that graphic in your document.  Here are a couple of examples, drawn from Wikipedia:  

    Biochemistry | Economics

2. Read the notes on [*Starting with R*](../CourseNotes/Rbasics/R-Basics.Rmd).
    a. Do these exercises based on the notes.  Put your answers in the `AssignmentOne.Rmd` file, giving a subsection header (`###`) for each exercise.
        1. [Names and Strings](../Exercises/Introductory/2013-08-12-DTK-View-String.html)
        #. [World Cities](../Exercises/Introductory/2013-08-12-DTK-World-Cities.html)
        #. [Seatbelts](../Exercises/Introductory/2013-08-12-DTK-Seatbelts.html)
        #. [Sleep Data](../Exercises/Introductory/2013-08-12-DTK-msleep.html)
#. Read the notes on *[File Types, Data, and Documents](../CourseNotes/DataOrganization/FileTypes.html).*.  Do these exercises:
    a. Use `file.choose()` in the console to find the full path name of this Rmd file.  Paste the result into the answers you are writing in this document.
    #. the second ... 
#. Enter the information on how long you worked in the [time log](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lH02nfMVvVmCxyus3TBHQvG58pV-cGDEcTfaBJAIk3k/viewform). [The class's data are viewable [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ROnT3PBL_iVguJQPKrGAXncf-wHKzEYHQQtE7c6JYG4/pubhtml).]

## Exercises on structure of data: 

* Non-tidy: <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5098197/Math155/ActiveDuty_MaritalStatus.xls>
* Long and Narrow: Create a sketch of a data table about lab experiments, where the same plants are being studied repeatedly: longitudinal data, e.g. like this:  

Height of plant

Plant | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3
------|--------|--------|--------
A     |  17    |  19    |  21
B     |  14    |  14    |  12

Now imagine that you want to deal with some other situations:

* For some plants, the measurements were made 10 days apart.
* You want to include the name of the person doing the height measurement for a given plant in each week.
* You decide to do some assays for various plant hormones over time.
