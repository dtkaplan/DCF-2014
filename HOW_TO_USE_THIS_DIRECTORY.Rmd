## Main documents

These are documents for organization.

* `TopicList.Rmd` 

## Course Notes

There is a `CourseNotes` directory that contains subdirectories for each section in the `TopicList.Rmd`.  

In each of those directories are:

* `DraftNarrative.Rmd` for fragments intended for the final `Narrative.Rmd`
* `IdeasAndResources.Rmd` for section specific ideas and links to sources of data, etc.

## Exercises

Not quite sure.  Perhaps:

* Directory `FinishedExercises`
* Directory `DraftExercises` ????
