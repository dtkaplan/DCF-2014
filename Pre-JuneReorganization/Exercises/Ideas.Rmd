## Student Work

As a start, let's divide student work into three categories:

1. Drill
    Questions whose answer can be found by simple examination or a trivial computation: one to three lines.  Fixed choice falls under this category.  Should **not** require an Rmd template.
2. Exercises
    Problems whose solution requires several lines of programming or an narrative explanation that is several paragraphs.  Should **not** require an Rmd template.
3. Activities
    Problems of an extended nature requiring an Rmd template.
    
## Mechanics of writing questions and problems

Each exercise or activity should be placed in its own Rmd file.  There might be several related drill problems in an Rmd file.

For silly reasons, the file **must be named** in this format: `2014-06-10-[unique descriptive name]`.  The unique descriptive name need only be unique for the attached date.  The date can be anything you want, e.g. `1918-11-11-`, so long as its in the right format.

There will be `yaml` front matter at the top of the Rmd file.  It looks like this:

    categories:
    - join
    - inner_join
    - caseMedicare
    - interpretation
    - graphics
    tags: 
    - Erik Anderson [the author]
    - data [filenames]
    - and so on

We need to construct a library of categories that reflect the content and structure of the course.  For now, just try what comes to mind.  We'll sort it out after we have a couple of dozen files.

Put answers inside `<aside> </aside>` tags.  

## Drill Examples

* [Show a graph.] What sort of geom is ...?
* [Show a graph.] What are the variables involved in the frame?
* [Show a graph.] How many guides are there?
* How many cases are there in the inner_join of [give package name of table A] and [give package name of table B]?
* How many variables are plotted.

## Exercise Examples

* Find the number of `French` cases in [data table A]?
* Find the number of cases that are both `English` and `antique` in [data table B]?
* Cluster the data in [data table C] and make a graph showing the clusters.
* Using `mutate()`, construct [some new variable] and [give some report of it, e.g. mean, graph, ... ]

## Activity Examples

Early in the course, these might be straightforward, with an Rmd template showing how to access data, make various sorts of plots, etc.

Later in the course, the activities should involve some or all of 

* data transformations (e.g. group, summarize, filter, join, melt)
* making graphics
* choosing graphics

Imagine an activity to take 15 minutes to 1 hour.

They should be drawn from case studies.  



## Miscellaneous Examples

This is not complete.

### Parsing Graphics

<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/12/15/us/politics/DEBATE.html?_r=0>

* How many layers are there?  (Make separate judgments for static and dynamic)
* For each layer, what is the frame?
* For each frame, what does the data table look like that underlies the graph?


Lots of examples of visualizations: <http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/data-visualized-more-on-teaching-with-infographics/?action=click&module=Search&region=searchResults&mabReward=relbias%3Ar&url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry401%23%2Fdata+visualization>

Trajectory infographic: explain what the glyphs are and what data they encode.

### Making Graphics

Create a scatter plot showing the location of the world's largest cities.  Code the population glyph with a radius that's the square-root of the population.  Use colors to indicate countries or deciles of the population, or regions.

`CaseStudies/Cities/ListOfCities.RData`

## Summarize

Find the mean of the latitude and longitude for each country.  Plot these out with total urban population as the glyph size.

`CaseStudies/Cities/ListOfCities.RData`

### Join

Find the population of each country.  Join this with the population in cities $> 1,000,000$.  Make a map showing the "large urban population fraction" in each country.

Also need to join in the country names.

## Layout of data

The spreadsheet [here](http://vote.minneapolismn.gov/www/groups/public/@clerk/documents/webcontent/wcms1p-126724.xlsx) contains data on the Minneapolis 2013 election by ward and precinct.  Identify the elements of this spreadsheet that are not in standard form for a data table.  [Cached copy](wcms1p-126724.xlsx)


## What Fraction

What Fraction of each country's population lives in cities $> 500,000$.  Get country-wide population from `CIAdata(2199)` and use `data(WorldCities,package='DCFdevel')` to add up the country.  Need to locate the two-letter country codes.  They are listed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2]: Data scraping exercise.  And [here they are](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pudo/lobbytransparency/master/etl/countrycodes.csv) in a CSV format. And [still another](http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm). And [another](http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/codes/country.htm)



Another exercise: verify these.
