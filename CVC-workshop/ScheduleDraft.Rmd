## Monday

1. RStudio and Rmd
    i. ACTIVITY: Write and publish a description of some straightforward, data-oriented topic you'd like to present in class.  Keep it simple.  We'll do more complex things in the 2nd half of the workshop.
#. Basic R
    a. arithmetic and syntax
    #. basic data types: numeric, character, factor
    #. variable names versus strings
    #. vectors, lists, dataframes
    #. formulas
    #. NA, NaN, and NULL
#. Data Organization
    a. Table/case/variable/row/column
    #. Why Common excel formats violate this
    #. Brief examination of table operations:
        i. mosaic table-making operators and the formula notation
        #. `mutate()`, `summarize()`, and `group_by()`
#. Parts of graphics
    a. Frame, Scale, Glyph, Guide, Facet
        i. Use "named" graphics at first: scatterplot, barplot 
    #. Information encoding in glyphs  
    #. Make a 6-second Vine video about graphics, like [this one](https://vine.co/v/MI5DM173wWz) and [this one](https://vine.co/v/MI5EWixM65A) about glyphs.
#. Introducing `ggplot`
    a. Dynamite plots
        i. give a simple dataset that can be translated into a dynamite plot
        #. show some alternatives
    #. Other geoms with other data sets
    #. `mPlot()` and `mBar()`
#. Graph to data: 
    a. Figure out what the glyph-ready data looks like
#. Data to graph
    i. Draw this graph
    ii. Data that's not yet ready.  Identify what you need to do to get it in shape.
#. The idea of a backstory
    a. Show sort of data that underlies the dynamite plot
    #. Something that involves a join.
#. `summarize()`
#. `mutate()` and common sorts of operations
    #. ratios, rates
    #. ???
#. `filter()`
#. `group_by()` these operations (using groupwise properties)


#. Report on your mini-case (first 6 people or groups @ 5 minutes)

## Tuesday

1. Sources of data, and how to get it in to R
    #. Files, URLs, CSV, Workspaces, 
    #. From Excel
    #. Databases.  Example from Randy about FAA Flights: <http://www.calvin.edu/~rpruim/talks/LessVolume/2014-05-29-GreatPlainsRUsers/dplyrLessVolume.html>
#. Identifying sources of data from your mini-case study
    #. Work in groups?  
#. Join operation
    
#. Report on your mini-case (second 6 people or groups @ 5 minutes)

## Notes

The first 2.5 days includes:

* an introduction to using R for handling data and graphics
* deconstructing graphs to the underlying data
* constructing graphics from data
* data wrangling: operations to get data in the right form for graphics

The second 2.5 days includes:

* quick review of the first half of workshop
* one-on-one or small group (by discipline) development of case studies.
* summarizing data with models
* data cleaning
* data web-scraping basics 
* programming in R (as needed)

## Readings
