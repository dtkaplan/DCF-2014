There are several small, example data tables in the `datasets` package.  Look at the `Seatbelts` data table using the `View()` function and the name of the object as an argument.


* What is the meaning of the `front` variable?
* How many cases are there?
* What is the real-world meaning of a case?
* How many letters are there in a typical entry for `country`?
