There are several small, example data tables in the `ggplot2` package.  Look at the `msleep` data table by using the `View()` function with the name of the object as an argument.

* What is the meaning of the `brainwt` variable?
* How many cases are there?
* What is the real-world meaning of a case?
* What are the levels of the `vore` variable?
