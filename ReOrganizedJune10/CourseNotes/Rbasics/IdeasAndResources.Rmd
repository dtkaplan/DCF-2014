## Exercise Ideas


### One

The `babyNames` dataframe (in the DCF package) gives the number of babies given each name in each year.  See \code{help(babyNames)}.

What will be returned by each of these commands?  If an error message is displayed, explain what is wrong with the command.

1. `names(babyNames)`
1. `name(babyNames)`
1. `with(babyNames, names)`
1. `with(babyNames, name)`
