### Tidy format

Table in PDF document from the DOJ on [Nonfatal Domestic Violence](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ndv0312.pdf).  What's non-tidy about the data in this table?

### Variables

What's non-tidy about the data in [this table](http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_230.60.asp)?  

Imagine a new table where the case is an individual child who has been bullied. (This is sometimes called "micro-data," a term that makes sense only if one thinks that "data" are summaries.) What would the tidy data from which this table is derived look like?

### Wrangler Data from App

Migration data `migration-example.csv`  What are the variables?  Re-arrange this in tidy format.

Crime data --- the data shown in [their video](http://vimeo.com/19185801) --- in `crime-example.csv`.  Put this table into tidy format. (Hint: Here's a video showing a tool for doing this.  You don't need to learn about the tool, just look at the final result.)
