Drill on data verbs:  
* mutate(), arrange(), filter(), select()

Drill on wide/narrow:  
* pivot, fold, gather, spread, unite, ...
* NCI60 --- just the probe data.  Change to narrow format and find the probes with the highest standard deviation of expression across all cell lines.

### Filter

CVC/Summer2014/Activities/Migration.Rmd --- there are all sorts of rank comparisons here involving the maximum, top five, and so on.

Ordway bird seasonality: See <file:///Users/kaplan/KaplanFiles/MOSAIC/CVC/Summer2013/Session3/RelationalData.html#/21>    
* Pick out the 10 most common bird species.  How does their capture differ by month.

Disasters: Make US maps showing, for different types of disasters, where they happen the most.

Pick out the zip codes you would target for:

* lots of elderly.
* young people and high income.

### Long and Narrow

Turn the immigration data into narrow, so that you can calculate the pairs that are close to being bilateral.  

### Mutate:

* Rates in the country data, e.g. miles of road per area, 
* Fraction alive, cardio, other in NHANES
* ifelse and rounds in the mayoral data: CVC/Summer2014/Activies/MinneapolisMayoralElection.Rmd
* Where do the elderly live in the US?  Zip-code data: see <file:///Users/kaplan/KaplanFiles/MOSAIC/CVC/Summer2014/Notes/GraphicsBasics/graphics-basics.html#17>

### Graphics:  

* Kids names by sex over the years: Winston, Adolf, the ones from Netta.
