## Too Much Data?

Redo this plot with the entire NHANES data:
```{r echo=FALSE}
Small <- sample_n( NHANES, size=2000 )
ggplot(data=Small,aes(x=age,y=height))+geom_point()+aes(colour=sex)
```

Use this to talk about overplotting and `alpha=`.

## Order of categorical variable:

How to set the order of display of a categorical variable by another variable's value.  See the Medicare example in GraphicsCommands.Rmd

## Log Axes

Redo the NHANES mortality as a logistic regression.



Show fraction alive as a function of sex and smoking status.

Show proportion in each age of the height ntiles.  Stack them.
