## Making Data Graphics: Introduction

Steps:

1. Choose a modality: `scatter()`, `density()`, `barplot()`, `network()`.
2. Choose the variable that corresponds to each aspect of the plot.
3. Cut and paste the command into your report.

These functions just construct graphics.  The data already need to be in a form where there is a variable for each aspect being used, e.g. an x- and y-variable for a scatter plot.
